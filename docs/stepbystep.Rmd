# Summary
This code creates an EML file for a data package. In this case the example is an EVER AA dataset, which consists of two data files, both located in the [Example_files](../Example_files) folder:

  * [qry_Export_AA_Points.csv](../Example_files/qry_Export_AA_Points.csv)
  * [qr_Export_AA_VegetationDetails.csv](../Example_files/qry_Export_AA_VegetationDetails.csv)

This is a step by step process where each section should be reviewed and edited if necessary, and run one by one. Several sections are labeled as optional and may only apply to certain data packages. 

The final section has the *make_eml()* function to put together the full metadata file.

# Before you Start

## Install Required Software:
You will need to install R and may find RStudio helpful. Both can be installed from Software Center without need for admin rights on your machine. For more information, see the R Advisory Group's [website](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/nps-nrss-imdiv/SitePages/R-Adv.aspx).

If you've never installed EMLassemblyline, you'll needed to install it (as well as some other packages) and then load them into R's working memory:

```{r install_packages, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE} 
## install necessary packages:
install.packages(c("devtools", "lubridate", "tidyverse")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("EDIorg/EMLassemblyline")
  
#Load required packages
library(EMLassemblyline)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Initiate a Draft Reference in DataStore:
You will need to know the URLs of your data files. These will be located on DataStore. Got to DataStore, select "Create" from the green drop down menu and then choose "Draft Reference". For now, select "Tabular Dataset" as the reference type (Data Package Reference Type coming soon!). Make sure to take note of the 7-digit code for the Reference as you will need it later.

Don't activate the reference yet!

# Using the Template:

## Provide Information About the Data Package:

```{r packageDetails, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Metadata filename - this becomes the filename, so make sure it ends in _metadata to comply with the NPS data package specifications
metadata_id <- "TEST_EVER_AA_metadata"

#Overall package title (replace with your title).
package_title <- "TEST_Title"

#Description of data collection status - choose from 'ongoing' or 'complete'
data_type <- "complete"
```

## Files: Local path
Tell EMLassemblyline where your files are (and what they are). 

For vectors with more than one item, keep the order the same (i.e. item #1 should correspond to the same file in each vector).

```{r datafiles, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Path to data file(s). The default "getwd()" assumes that your working directory in R is the directory where your data files for your data package are.

#to check your current working directory use >getwd()

#To change your working directory use >setwd("path/to/my/datafiles"). 

#Alternatively you can continue working in your current directory and assign the path to your data files to 'working_folder' instead of 'getwd()'
working_folder <- getwd() 

#Vector of dataset filenames. Tell EMLassemblyline what the names of your datafiles are. Watch out for spelling and case. 
data_files <- c("qry_Export_AA_Points.csv", "qry_Export_AA_VegetationDetail.csv")
  
#Vector of dataset names (brief name for each file). Make sure the names of are in the same order as the file names!
data_names <- c("TEST_AA Point Data","TEST_AA Vegetation Data")
  
#Vector of dataset descriptions (about 10 words describing each file). Descriptions will be used in auto-generated tables within the ReadMe and DRR. If need to use more than about 10 words, consider putting that information in the abstract, methods, or additional info sections. Again, be sure these are in the same order as your data files!
data_descriptions <- c("TEST_Everglades Vegetation Map Accuracy Assessment point data","Everglades Vegetation Map Accuracy Assessment vegetation data")
```

## Files: Ultimate URL
Tell EMLassemblyline where your files will ultimately be located.
Create a vector of dataset URLs - for DataStore I recommend setting this to the main reference page. All data files from a single data package can be accessed from the same page so the URLs are the same.

```{r fileURLs, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#The code from the draft reference you initiated above (replace 293181 with your code)
DSRefCode<-2293181

#No need to edit this
DSURL<-paste0("https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/", DSRefCode)

#Change the number of reps to correspond to the number of datafiles in your data package (in this example, 2):
data_urls <-c(rep(DSURL, 2))
```

Tell EMLassembly line where to find the table and field that contains scientific names. These will be used to fill the taxonomic coverage metadata. If you don't have scientific names (e.g. water quality), skip this step and do not run OPTIONAL 5 (below).

```{r sciNames, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data_taxa_table <- "qry_Export_AA_VegetationDetail.csv"
data_taxa_field <- "Scientific_Name"
```

## Geographic Coordinates:
Tell EMLassemblyline where to find the table and fields that contain the geographic coordinates and site names that can be used to fill the geographic coverage metadata. Comment these out and do not run OPTIONAL 4 (below) if your data package does not contain geographic information.

Coordinates must be in decimal degrees and include a minus sign (-) for latitudes south of the equator and longitudes west of the prime meridian. For points, repeat latitude and longitude coordinates in respective north/south and east/west columns. If you need to convert from UTMs, try using the UTMtoLL function in the [R/QCkit](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/QCkit) package.

The example below will generate a single point for each site. We strongly encourage you to be as precise as possible with your geographicCoverage and provide sampling pionts (e.g. along a transect) whenever possible. This information will (eventually) be displayed on a map on the DataStore Reference page for the data package and these points will also be directly discoverable through DataStore searches.

If you have CUI concerns about the specific locations of your sites, consider fuzzing them rather than completely removing them. One good tool for fuzzing geographic coordinates is the dp_fuzzLocation function in the [R/QCkit](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/QCkit) package.

```{r goeCov, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data_coordinates_table <- "qry_Export_AA_Points.csv"
data_latitude <- "Latitude"
data_longitude <- "Longitude"
data_sitename <- "SiteName"
```

## Start and End Dates:    
The start date and end date This should indicate the first and last data point in the data package (across all files) and does not include any planning, pre- or post-processing time.  The format should be one that complies with the International Standards Organization's standard 8601. The recommended format for EML is:
#YYYY-MM-DD, where Y is the four digit year, M is the two digit month code (01 - 12 for example, January = 01), and D is the two digit day of the month (01 - 31).

```{r startEndDates, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
startdate <- mdy("2010-01-26")
enddate <- mdy("2013-01-04")
```

## Optional Items:
The next set of optional items are meant to be considered one by one and only run if applicable to a particular data package. The first year will typically see all of these run, but if the data format and protocol stays constant over time it may be possible to skip some or all of these in future years.
  
### OPTIONAL 1
Creates blank TXT template files for the abstract, additional information, custom units, intellectual rights, keywords, methods, and personnel. Some of these .txt files are easily edited in text editors (e.g. abstract.txt) but some are best edited in Excel (or another spreadsheet application), for instance the personnel.txt file.

For specific guidance on editing these templates, see the [documentation on editing templates](edit_tmplts.html).
  
Typically these files can be reused between years. 

You must edit the "intellectual_rights.txt" file:

  *   If you have CUI, replace the CCO license with the following text:
  
```{css style settings, echo = FALSE}
blockquote {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    margin: 0 0 20px;
    font-size: 12px;
    border-left: 5px solid #eee;
}
```
  
  > "This product has been determined to contain Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) by the National Park Service, and is intended for internal use only. It is not published under an open license. Unauthorized access, use, and distribution are prohibited.” 
  
  * If you have no CUI, the default is the public domain. Replace the CCO text with the following text:
  
  > "This work is in the public domain. There is no copy right or license."
  
  * If you need a license, for instance because the data were generated by non-NPS contractors or in collaboration with non-NPS partners, use the default license="CCO".
  
```{r core_metadata, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}  
template_core_metadata(path = working_folder, license = "CC0")
```

### OPTIONAL 2
Creates an "attributes_datafilename.txt" file for each data file. This can be opened in Excel (I recommend against trying to update these in a text editor) and fill in/adjust the columns for attributeDefinition, class, unit, etc. refer to the [webpage on editing templates](edit_tmplts.html) for helpful hints and use *view_unit_dictionary()* for potential units. This will only need to be run again if the attributes (name, order or new/deleted fields) are modified from the previous year. NOTE that if this already exists from a previous run, it is not overwritten.

```{r attributes, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
template_table_attributes(path = working_folder, data.table = data_files, write.file = TRUE)
```

### OPTIONAL 3
Creates a "catvars_datafilename.txt" file for each data file that has columns with a class = categorical. These txt files will include each unique 'code' and allow input of the corresponding 'definition'.NOTE that since the list of codes is harvested from the data itself, it's possible that additional codes may have been relevant/possible but they are not automatically included here. Consider your lookup lists carefully to see if additional options should be included (e.g if your dataset DPL values are all set to "Accepted" this function will not include "Raw" or "Provisional" in the resulting file and you may want to add those manually). NOTE that if this already exists from a previous run, it is not overwritten.

```{r catvars, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
template_categorical_variables(path = working_folder, data.path = working_folder, write.file = TRUE)
```

### OPTIONAL 4
Creates a geographic_coverage.txt file that lists your sites as points as long as your coordinates are in lat/long. If your coordinates are in UTM it is probably easiest to convert them first or create the geographic_coverage.txt file another way. For isntance, try using the UTMtoLL function in [R/QCkit](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/QCkit).

```{r geoCov, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
template_geographic_coverage(path = working_folder, 
                             data.path = working_folder, 
                             data.table = data_coordinates_table, 
                             lat.col = data_latitude, 
                             lon.col = data_longitude, 
                             site.col = data_sitename, 
                             write.file = TRUE)
```

### OPTIONAL 5
Creates a taxonomic_coverage.txt file if you have taxonomic data. In terms of authorities 3 = ITIS, 9 = WORMS, and 11 = GBIF. Turning this function on may dramatically increase the time it takes for the *make_eml()* function to run, especially if you have many taxa or a slow internet connection. You may want to consider turning this off for testing/development purposes.

```{r taxCov, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
template_taxonomic_coverage(path = working_folder, 
                            data.path = working_folder, 
                            taxa.table = data_taxa_table, 
                            taxa.col = data_taxa_field, 
                            taxa.authority = c(3,11), 
                            taxa.name.type = 'scientific', 
                            write.file = TRUE)
```

## Make the EML:
Run this (it may take a little while) and see if it validates (you should see 'Validation passed'). Additionally there could be some issues that review as well. Run the function 'issues()' at the end of the process to get feedback on items that might be missing.

```{r makeEML, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
make_eml(path = working_folder,
           dataset.title = package_title,
           data.table = data_files,
           data.table.name = data_names,
           data.table.description = data_descriptions,
           data.table.url = data_urls,
           temporal.coverage = c(startdate, enddate),
           maintenance.description = data_type,
           package.id = metadata_id)
```

# Finished? Not quite...
Now that you have valid EML metadata, you need to add NPS-specific elements and fields. For instance, unit connections, DOIs, referencing a DRR, etc. To do that, use the [R/EMLeditor](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/EML_editor) package.
